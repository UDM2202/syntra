## 🚀 Overview

**Syntra** is an **autonomous intelligence exchange** where AI agents buy, sell, and trade predictive market intelligence. It creates a machine-native intelligence economy where specialized AI agents generate trading signals, a trader agent consumes and aggregates these signals, and a reputation system continuously updates trust based on outcomes.

### Key Features

- 🤖 **3 Specialized AI Agents** - Whale, Narrative, and Derivatives agents generate real-time signals
- 📊 **Real Market Data** - Powered by CoinMarketCap API (CMC)
- 🔗 **On-Chain Execution** - Real trades on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) via PancakeSwap
- 💰 **Real P&L** - Actual profit/loss from real trades, not simulations
- 🛡️ **Reputation System** - Trust scores update based on trade outcomes
- 🌐 **Multi-Wallet Support** - Connect MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and more
- 📱 **Responsive UI** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- 🔐 **Self-Custody** - Users control their own private keys and funds

---

## 🌟 Vision

Financial markets today are driven by information asymmetry. Syntra introduces a new primitive:

> **Intelligence itself becomes a tradable financial asset between autonomous agents.**

Instead of one AI trying to analyze everything, Syntra creates:
- **Specialized intelligence agents**
- **A marketplace for signals**
- **A trading agent that consumes intelligence**
- **A feedback loop that rewards accuracy**

This forms the foundation of a **machine-native intelligence economy**.

## 🧩 Core Components

### 1. Intelligence Provider Agents

#### 🐋 Whale Agent
- **Purpose:** Detects "smart money" movement
- **Data Source:** CMC API (large wallet transactions, market trends)
- **Outputs:** Direction (bullish/bearish), confidence score, signal price

#### 📰 Narrative Agent
- **Purpose:** Detects market narrative strength
- **Data Source:** CMC API (sentiment, momentum, price changes)
- **Outputs:** Narrative direction, momentum score, confidence

#### 📊 Derivatives Agent
- **Purpose:** Analyzes funding and leverage conditions
- **Data Source:** CMC API (derivatives data)
- **Outputs:** Squeeze risk, market imbalance, confidence

### 2. Trader Agent (Consumer)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Queries all provider agents
  - Compares signals
  - Purchases intelligence
  - Aggregates signals
  - Computes conviction score
  - Decides BUY / NO BUY
  - Executes simulated or real trades

### 3. Marketplace
- **Registry of intelligence providers**
- Each provider has: name, type, price, trust score, accuracy score
- Used for discovery and selection

### 4. Reputation Engine
- **Updates trust based on outcomes**
- **MVP Formula:** `Trust Score = (0.6 × Accuracy) + (0.4 × Consistency)`
- **Key rules:**
  - Updated after each trade
  - Visible in dashboard
  - Drives future selection

### 5. Execution Layer
- **Unified Interface:** `buy_intelligence()`, `execute_trade()`, `register_agent()`
- **SIM mode** (default, guaranteed working)
- **REAL mode** (optional, BSC + PancakeSwap)

Click the "Wallet" tab

Click "Connect Wallet"

Select MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or another provider

Approve the connection in your wallet

2. Fund Your Agent Wallet
Get your agent address from the Wallet tab

Send BNB to this address (minimum 0.01 BNB for gas fees)

Wait for confirmation on BSC

3. Start Trading
AI Auto-Trading
Click the "AI Trading" tab

Click "Start Auto"

The AI will automatically:

Read market data from CMC

Generate signals from 3 agents

Calculate conviction scores

Execute trades on BSC

Update reputation

Manual Trading
Click the "Real Trading" tab

Enter your trade details (BUY/SELL, amount)

Click "Execute"

Confirm the transaction in your wallet

4. Monitor Performance
Stats Bar: Shows real-time balance, trades, win rate, P&L

Live Signals: View signals from all 3 agents

AI Trading: See decisions and execution results

Reputation: Track trust scores of each agent

🔒 Security
Best Practices
Never commit .env file to version control

Use separate wallet for trading (not your main wallet)

Start with small amounts ($1-5) for testing

Enable 2FA on all exchange accounts

Whitelist IP addresses for API keys

Monitor daily limits to prevent large losses

Keep private keys secure - never share them

API Key Security
bash
# .env is already in .gitignore
# Never commit it to GitHub
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
Wallet Security
Use a dedicated agent wallet

Keep minimal funds for gas fees

Withdraw profits regularly

Monitor transactions on BSCScan

🐛 Known Issues
Fixed Issues (June 2026)
Trust Wallet extension conflict - Fixed issue where wallet was connected but window.ethereum.selectedAddress returned undefined. Root cause: multiple wallet providers competing for injection. Resolution: disable unused wallet extensions and use custom RainbowKit wallet connection flow.

NaN Balance Display - Fixed NaN appearing before wallet address when connecting. Added safe numeric validation with fallback to '0.0000'.

Trade Recording - Fixed trades not being recorded in backend. Added /api/record-trade endpoint and frontend sync.

Transaction Rejection Errors - Fixed "Transaction rejected in wallet" appearing without wallet popup. Proper wallet connection state synchronization.

Remaining Issues
Trade statistics depend on backend status endpoint consistency

Open position management is still basic

No automated sell logic yet

P&L tracking currently relies on completed trade records

Position lifecycle tracking can be improved
